.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility offers combined kernel and base system upgrades using
remotely fetched binary sets, as well as package upgrades via
.Xr pkg 8 .
.Pp
Options
.Sq Fl b ,
.Sq Fl k ,
.Sq Fl p
and
.Sq Fl t
may be stacked to create selective updates.
The default is
.Sq Fl bkp ,
attempting to update all installed components at once using
a minor upgrade sequence.
Major upgrades are invoked using e.g.\&
.Sq Fl ur Ar 17.1 ,
instead.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl m Ar mirror_url" -offset indent
.It Fl a Ar abi
Change the
.Ar abi
from the detected default to a specific value.
This does not affect
.Sq Fl p .
.It Fl B
Execute single-step base system upgrade after use of
.Sq Fl u .
Implies
.Sq Fl f .
.It Fl b
Select the base system.
.It Fl c
Check wether a base/kernel update can be performed, but don't install it.
.It Fl d
Restore the repository defaults.
.It Fl e
Empty the cache directory.
.It Fl f
Force an update even when the latest release is already installed.
.It Fl g
Use a debug kernel instead of the release kernel.
.It Fl i
Ignore the signature verification result.
.It Fl k
Select the kernel.
.It Fl L
Lock a set to avoid updates.
The lock will be stripped by
.Sq Fl U
or
.Sq Fl u ,
and ingored temporarily by
.Sq Fl f .
.It Fl l Ar directory
Instead of downloading, point to a local directory where the base and
kernel sets are stored.
.It Fl M
Return the full release URL of the selected mirror.
.It Fl m Ar mirror_url
Change the set fetch and package location to
.Ar mirror .
.It Fl N Ar crypto_lib
When using
.Sq Fl up ,
the cryptographic library may be specified.
Possible values are
.Sq OpenSSL
or
.Sq LibreSSL .
The value
.Sq Base
is reserved for future use.
.It Fl n Ar mirror_dir
Change the package repository to
.Ar flavour .
.It Fl P
Execute single-step packages upgrade after use of
.Sq Fl u .
Implies
.Sq Fl f .
.It Fl p
Select the packages.
.It Fl r Ar release
Select the
.Ar release
to be installed.
Package upgrades are unaffected by this option when not using
.Sq Fl u .
.It Fl s
Skip update phase; useful in conjunction with
.Sq Fl m
and
.Sq Fl n .
.It Fl S
Check the size of the requested remote base, kernel or package set.
.It Fl T
Print the current release package name or the kernel or base set lock
status, exiting with an error if the respective set is locked.
.It Fl t Ar type
Switch to the release package
.Ar type ,
properly handling the
.Xr pkg 8
.Sq vital
flag transition.
.It Fl U
Unlock a set to allow updates.
Sets are generally unlocked unless
.Sq Fl L
was used.
.It Fl u
Invoke a major upgrade, which requires explicit use of
.Sq Fl r .
In order to finish the upgrade,
.Sq Fl B
and
.Sq Fl P
must be invoked in this particular order, accompanied by a reboot
after each individual step.
.It Fl V
Set debug mode for shell script output.
.It Fl v
Print the latest base/kernel version.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/OPNsense.conf
The
.Xr pkg.conf 5
file used to configure the packages mirror.
The file is rewritten in case of
.Sq Fl d ,
.Sq Fl m
or
.Sq Fl n .
.It Pa /usr/local/opnsense/version/base
The file is used to check if a base system upgrade is necessary.
It is typically shipped with the base set.
.It Pa /usr/local/opnsense/version/base.lock
The lock for preventing an update to the base system,
operated by
.Sq Fl \&Lb
and
.Sq Fl \&Ub .
.It Pa /usr/local/opnsense/version/kernel
The file is used to check if a kernel upgrade is necessary.
It is typically shipped with the kernel set.
.It Pa /usr/local/opnsense/version/kernel.lock
The lock for preventing updates to the kernel,
operated by
.Sq Fl \&Lk
and
.Sq Fl \&Uk .
.It Pa /var/cache/opnsense-update
The local cache storage directory.
